<div style={{textAlign:"justify", margin:"1em 0em"}}>
    Autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most frequent genetic cause of end-stage renal disease in adults. Affected individuals and families face a significant medical and psychosocial burden due to both renal and extrarenal manifestations. This documentation reviews the current best-practice management of ADPKD patients, focusing on interventions that have reached clinical use to maintain kidney function. It also provides an outlook on future trials and potential novel treatment strategies.
