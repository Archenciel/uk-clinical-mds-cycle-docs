## ADPKD Therapy options: 

## State-of-the-Art Pharmacotherapy

- **Focus Shift:** Towards pharmacological interventions with disease-modifying effects.
- **Central Role:** Intracellular cAMP levels in cystogenesis and cyst expansion.

### V2 Receptor Blockade

- **Vasopressin Role:** Induces cAMP generation and drives cyst expansion.
- **Tolvaptan:** V2 receptor inhibitor; reduces kidney growth rate and attenuates eGFR loss.
- **Clinical Trials:** TEMPO 3:4, TEMPO 4:4, REPRISE trials support tolvaptan's effectiveness.

### Somatostatin Analogues

- **Somatostatin Signaling:** Reduces cAMP levels; potential in rodent models.
- **Trials:** Phase 2 and 3 trials exploring somatostatin analogues.

### Repurposing Drugs

- **Promising Strategy:** Drugs with established safety profiles for other indications.
- **Evaluated Drugs:** Statins, metformin, mTOR inhibitors.
- **Current Status:** Lovastatin and metformin show benefits; mTOR inhibitors not conclusive.
- **Ongoing Exploration:** Tyrosine kinase inhibitors and targeted therapies.

## Conclusion

- **ADPKD Management Advances:** Breakthroughs in molecular pathogenesis and drug interventions.
- **Tolvaptan:** First approved disease-modifying therapy, offering benefits in kidney growth and function preservation.
- **Future Prospects:** Repurposing drugs and potential combination therapies in ongoing clinical trials continue to enhance understanding.
