## Introduction to Nephrology
<Grid container spacing={4} margin="0em 0em">
    <Grid xs={12} sm={7} margin="1em 0em" style={{textAlign:"justify"}}>
        Nephrology is a medical specialty focused on the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the kidneys. 
        It encompasses a wide range of conditions, including acute and chronic kidney diseases, kidney transplantation, hypertension, and electrolyte disturbances. 
        The integration of Medical Data Science into nephrology is revolutionizing patient care and research in this field.
    
    ### Understanding Nephrology
        Nephrology involves managing diseases that affect kidney function.
        These conditions can have widespread effects throughout the body, necessitating a holistic approach to treatment.

#### Key Areas in Nephrology:
<div style={{textAlign:"justify", margin:"1em 0em"}}>
    - Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD): A long-term condition where the kidneys do not work effectively.
    - Acute Kidney Injury (AKI): Sudden damage to the kidneys, often reversible with prompt treatment.
    - Glomerular Diseases: Conditions affecting the tiny filtering units of the kidneys.
    - Kidney Transplantation: Surgical procedure to place a healthy kidney from a donor into a person whose kidneys no longer function properly.
    - Dialysis: A procedure to remove waste products and excess fluid from the blood when the kidneys stop working properly.
