# Exploring Data-Driven Innovation in the Clinical Domain

Data-driven innovation is a central objective in the field of Medical Data Science (MDS), aiming to leverage both clinical and non-clinical data to generate clinical value. Despite the rapid advancement of analytical methodologies and tools, including sophisticated AI models, the adoption of data-powered analytical software still lags significantly. Previous research has explored the challenges hindering practical adoption, but our study goes further by offering a comprehensive view of the data-driven innovation process in the clinical domain.

### Theoretical Framework

Our research integrates best practices from diverse domains and industries with the specific challenges inherent to the clinical sphere. We present a theoretical framework to structure data-driven innovation in the clinical domain. This framework encompasses various forms of data-driven innovation in clinical settings, delineates the primary and secondary stages of the cyclic process, outlines their interdependencies with concurrent innovation cycles, and identifies primary challenges unique to each phase.

### Contributions

Through this work, we establish the groundwork for categorizing data-driven innovations in the clinical domain, assessing their maturity, and pinpointing key challenges. It's important to note that our focus in this research is on providing a comprehensive overview, and we refrain from providing detailed strategies for addressing these challenges. In forthcoming work, we plan to delve into technological approaches for surmounting these hurdles.
